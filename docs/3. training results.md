# Training Results

I was unable to learn a robust representation for the company class during training. The champion model achieves reasonable performance overall (93.14% test accuracy), but the company class recall sits at only 59%, significantly lagging behind person and university classes.

The visualization above provides detailed interrogation of these performance gaps, showing where the model struggles and succeeds across different classes.

I acknowledge that these results are not optimal, particularly for the company class. With more time, I would explore improvements such as using a more sophisticated embedding model or incorporating NLTK-based feature extraction. However, I wanted to respect the time constraints of this project and deliver a working system within the available timeframe.
